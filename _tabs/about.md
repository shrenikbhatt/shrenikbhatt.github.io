Hey! I'm Shrenik and this is my blog where I plan on writing about things that interest me.

I recently graduated from the University of Toronto with a degree in Computer Engineering and a minor in AI.

I am interested in topics related to **Machine Learning**, **Computer Systems Programming**, and **Large-Scale Distributed Systems**.

I love meeting new people and learning new ideas so feel free to reach out to me at <hello@shrenikbhatt.com>!
